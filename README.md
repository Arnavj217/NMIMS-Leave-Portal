## 📝 How It Works

1. Student Registration  
   Students create an account, login, and apply for leave using a form (with date, reason, etc.).

2. Parent Registration & Approval  
   Parents register separately and view their child’s leave request, and can approve or reject it.

3. Mentor Approval  
   Once a parent approves the request, it is forwarded to the mentor for final review and decision.

4. Tracking  
   Students can log in to check the current status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
